# PySnake

## Snake game written using graphics library.

This is an copy of the classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. Guide the snake to collect food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls and itself. The game features additional food items with special effects, such as slowing down or mirroring the snake.

### Features
- Basic Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- Food Generation: The snake eats the food to grow longer.
- Special abilities: Slow snake down and teleport through walls.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score.
- Game Over Screen: Displayed when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

### Installation and Running the Game
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the Turtle graphics library if not already installed:
3. Clone / Download repository.
4. Run game in terminal or code eidtor.
  
### Special Food Effects:
- Green Food: Slows down the snake.
- Red Food: Enables the snake to teleport through walls.
- Blue Food: Normal behavior.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
- Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail.
- Special food items have different effects:
-- Green food slows down the snake.
-- Red food allows the snake to teleport through walls and safely pass through its own tail.
-- Blue food resets the snake to normal behaviour.
  
### Known Issues
- Performance issues when the snake gets too long.

- Adapted from Initial tutorial from Dr. Angela Yu Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
- Game over screen logic implemented with the help of ChatGPT.

### Future Enhancements
- Clean up and further modularise code
- Add more special effects and different food types with different abilities for snake.
- Improve graphics and animations.

### Disclaimers

This project is a personal learning exercise and may contain bugs or incomplete features. It was originally developed as part of a course and later extended with additional functionality. Please note the following:

- **Learning Purpose**: This project was primarily created to practice Python programming and game development concepts. The use use of graphics library rather than a gaming library is purely educational and fun.
- **Bug Notice**: There may be bugs or unexpected behavior, especially in edge cases or specific environments.
- **Dependencies**: A requirements file is not yet provided.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: While efforts have been made to ensure the game functions correctly, there are no guarantees of performance or reliability. Use the software at your own risk.
